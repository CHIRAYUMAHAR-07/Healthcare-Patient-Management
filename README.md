# Healthcare-Patient-Management
I built a Healthcare Patient Management Dashboard in Power BI to optimize patient data analysis. It provides insights into demographics, appointments, payments, emergency response efficiency, and recovery trends. Enhancing business intelligence, it aids data-driven decisions for medical professionals.
